These filters are designed to make it easy for stakeholders to drill down into the data and obtain the insights they need quickly.

## 4. AI Features
The report incorporates **four AI features** to enhance the analytics and provide deeper insights beyond traditional visualizations:
- **Anomaly Detection** to identify any unusual trends or outlier data points in project savings and client performance.
- **Forecasting** models that predict future savings based on historical trends and patterns.
- **Decomposition Tree** to break down and analyze project and client data in a hierarchical, drill-down manner.
- **Q&A Feature** (Bonus) that allows users to ask natural language questions and receive insights based on the dataset.
