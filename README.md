# CMPG 323 Project 5 - 39990966

## 1. Project Overview
The **NWU Tech Trends Benefit Realisation Report** is designed to provide an interactive view of the time savings realized by various clients and projects. Developed using **Power BI**, this report enables stakeholders to monitor and evaluate key metrics, project statuses, and client performance, emphasizing time savings and efficiency.

## 2. Report Pages and Features

### 2.1. High-Level Metrics Page
- **Purpose**: Summarizes crucial data points for decision-making.
- **Features**:
  - Summary view displaying counts of key metrics such as total time savings, number of projects, and clients.
  - Visualizations providing an overview of time savings across all clients and projects.

### 2.2. Client Monitoring Page
- **Purpose**: Allows monitoring of time savings at a client-specific level.
- **Features**:
  - Visual displays of time savings per client.
  - Time-based breakdown of savings changes over time for each client.

### 2.3. Project Monitoring Page
- **Purpose**: Offers a detailed view of ongoing projects and their performance.
- **Features**:
  - Visuals showing the total number of projects.
  - Three key metrics providing insights into project offerings.
  - Visualizations of savings accumulation over time and client associations for each project.

## 3. Filters
To enhance data analysis flexibility, the following filters are available across pages:
- **Project Filter**: Filter the report based on specific projects.
- **Client Filter**: Filter data for a specific client.
- **Date Range Filter**: Filter data by a custom date range.

These filters facilitate quick drilling down into data for tailored insights.

## 4. AI Features
The report incorporates **four AI features** to enhance analytics:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual trends in project savings and client performance.
- **Forecasting**: Predicts future savings based on historical data.
- **Decomposition Tree**: Analyzes data hierarchically, allowing for drill-down insights.
- **Q&A Feature** (Bonus): Users can ask natural language questions to gain insights from the dataset.

## 5. Live Connection and Scheduled Refresh

- **Live Connection**:
  - **Definition**: Queries data directly from the source without storing it in Power BIâ€™s memory.
  - **Applicable Data Sources**: 
    - Azure Analysis Services
    - SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular
    - SQL Server Analysis Services Multi-Dimensional
    - Power BI Service Dataset

- **Excel File Connection**:
  - **Limitation**: Excel files cannot utilize a live connection.
  - **Solution**: Implement a **scheduled refresh** to update data at regular intervals.

Live connections are ideal for scenarios requiring real-time data access.

## 6. How to Use the Report

### A. Accessing the Report
1. Open the report in Power BI by navigating to the assigned workspace.
2. Use the navigation panel to switch between the `High-Level Metrics`, `Client Monitoring`, and `Project Monitoring pages`.

### B. Interacting with the Report
- **Filters**: Utilize filters on the right-hand side to focus on specific clients, projects, or time periods.
- **Visual Interactions**: Click on visualizations to drill down into more granular data.
- **Export Data**: Use the **Export Data** option within each visual to download underlying data.

### C. Data Security
Data connections are securely configured to ensure the protection of sensitive information. Only authorized users with appropriate access levels can view or interact with the data.

## 7. AI Features Usage

### A. Anomaly Detection
- **How to Use**: Navigate to the designated AI features page and review the identified anomalies in project savings. Use this information to investigate underlying causes.

### B. Forecasting
- **How to Use**: Access the forecasting section to view predicted savings. Adjust the parameters if necessary for more tailored predictions.

### C. Decomposition Tree
- **How to Use**: Click on the tree visual to drill down into project and client data. This feature allows you to explore the data hierarchy and identify specific areas of interest.

### D. Q&A Feature
- **How to Use**: Utilize the Q&A box to type in natural language questions. For example, "What were the total savings for Client A in Q1?" The system will generate a visual response based on the data.
